## 🚀 Built with

* GatsbyJS for build process and speed
* ReactJS for components, state-management and code structure
* StyledComponents for styling
* GraphQL for fetching images from CDN
* PHP for saving contact forms to the backend

## 🧐 Structure?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    thecareerguys/src
    ├── components
    ├── data
    ├── images
    ├── pages
    ├── styles

1.  **`/components`**: Each major page of the website has it's own components folder. In the folder any components dedicated solely to that page will be included. Any shared components will be in their appropriate folder.

2.  **`/data`**: This contains a local copy of the JSON for the universities API. This is only used on the deployed version of the website as the request fails when trying to make a HTTP request from a secure site.

3.  **`images`**: All images and logos used in the project.

4.  **`pages`**: At build time these pages will be converted to the html pages that make up the website.

5.  **`styles`**: This is only used for some global styling. However, the majority of the styling is done through custom styled components.
